12.16	Fixed: 
		-p -e now set variables that echo after logging starts...rather than echoing beforehand
		version module called after setup so that it is also logged.
		email and private currently printed out in setup, can be moved to seperate module if needed.

12.15	Added: 2 flags 
		-p 	Private Result, results will not be in the public database
    		-e	Email results, a perfect pairing with private results.
    		use -e email@email.net

12.14	Fixed: Added better proc/core detection
		Added: Rudimentary detection of ARM vs x86
		Added: Printes out version of benchmark
12.13   Modified: Modified: Upload script to submit results
                strtoll library function is returning zero content length
                which makes Curl_readwrite in lib/transfer.c quit.
                It works for transfer -encoding type chunked as there it
                ignores content length and keep reading so this explains why
                it works for few sites and fails for rest. Implemented custom
                solution.
